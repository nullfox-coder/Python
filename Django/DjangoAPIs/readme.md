# Creating RestAPIs

1. Install Python, Django and DRF(Django Rest Framework)
2. Setup Django Models (models store data temporarily)
3. Set up Serializers (convert data to JSON)
4. Set Up Views (accepts request just like controls in java)
5. Setup Urls (which view works when) - mapping of urls and views
6. Test your APIs (with the help of Browser and Postman)
